# Partition

This is a simple program to demonstrate partition search. Selecting 1 at the menu allows you to add to the array. 2 will use partition search to find the K-th Smallest number in the array that was set up. 3 Exits.

An example is if you had [1, 2, 4, 22] the 3rd smallest number would be 4.
